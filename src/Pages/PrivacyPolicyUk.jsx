          </ol>
          <br />
          <h3>5. Privacy Impact Assessments</h3>
          <p>
            A Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) is a tool that helps ensure
            privacy is a core consideration to our business on an ongoing basis
            and when a new project or a significant change in Trackon’s business
            model is being planned and implemented. <br />
            <br />
            PIAs are meant to describe and document what personal information
            will be involved and what privacy controls are needed to be in place
            to ensure compliance and how we have improved our own privacy
            systems and practices over time. <br />
            <br />
            The 10 privacy principles, described above, guide how a PIA is
            conducted. Trackon must look at the design effectiveness,
            implementation, and operating effectiveness of privacy
            controls/processes.
            <br />
            <br />A sample PIA form is included as an appendix to this document.
            This form has been developed based on OPC guidance3, however, the
            Privacy Officer may make modifications to the form on an as-needed
            basis. <br />
            <br />
            The PIA form should be completed in conjunction with the Privacy
            Officer as it relates to new projects or significant change in
            Trackon’s business model. Any staff managing initiatives involving
            personal information must notify the Privacy Officer that a PIA is
            required, and work with the Privacy Officer to complete the PIA. In
            order to avoid delays, sufficient time must be allotted in project
            plans to allow for the completion of a PIA, as well as any risk
            mitigation implications deemed necessary. These must be completed
            prior to the “go live” date of new projects and/or processes. <br />
            <br />
            Staff that are uncertain as to whether or not a project or process
            change under their management has a privacy or PI related component
            that requires the completion of a PIA should contact the Privacy
            Officer.

          <h3>6. Breach Response Plan (Mandatory Breach Notification)</h3>
          <p>
            In the event Trackon suspects or has a breach of security
            safeguards, which is the loss of, unauthorized access to, or
            disclosure of, personal information under our control and if it is
            reasonable to believe the breach creates a real risk of significant
            harm, the breach must be reported to the Privacy Commissioner,
            regardless of how the potential breach was detected.. <br />
            The following are the steps we must take when we believe there is
            such a breach.
          </p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              Determine if there is a “real risk of significant harm” (RROSH);
            </li>
            <li>Report the breach;</li>
            <li>Notification; and</li>
            <li>Record keeping.</li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <h5>6.1 Determine if there is a “Real Risk of Significant Harm”</h5>
          <p>
            To determine if the breach poses a RROSH to any individual whose
            personal information was involved in the breach we must conduct a
            risk assessment. The following factors are some of the
            considerations that we must include in assessing the risks taken
            from OPC guidance4: <br />
            <br />
            Sensitivity of the personal information involved i.e. How sensitive
            is the information? Was the personal information adequately
            encrypted, anonymized or otherwise not easily accessible?
            Probability of Misuse. i.e. What happened and how likely is it that
            someone would be harmed by the breach? Who actually accessed or
            could have accessed the personal information? How long has the
            personal information been exposed? <br />
            <br />
            The cause and extent of the breach i.e. Is there a risk of ongoing
            breaches or further exposure of the information – is it a systemic
            issue? Has the personal information been recovered? <br />
            <br />
            The individuals affected by the breach i.e. How many individuals’
            personal information was involved? Who is affected by the breach:
            employees, customers, etc.?
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>6.2 Reporting the Breach</h5>
          <p>
            We must notify the privacy commissioner of any breach of security
            safeguards involving personal information under its control if it is
            reasonable to believe the breach creates a real risk of significant
            harm as determined in the step above. The report should contain the
            following:
          </p>
          <ol type="A">
            <li>
              A description of the circumstances of the breach and, if known,
              the cause;
            </li>
            <li>The day or the period in which the breach occurred;</li>
            <li>
              A description of the personal information that was involved in the
              breach;
            </li>
            <li>
              an estimate of the number of individuals impacted – where the
              breach creates a real risk of significant harm;
            </li>
            <li>
              The steps that the organization has taken to reduce the risk of
              harm to the impacted individuals;
            </li>
            <li>
              The steps that the organization has taken or will take to notify
              impacted individuals; and
            </li>
            <li>
              The name and contact information of a person who can answer, on
              behalf of the organization, the Privacy Commissioner’s questions
              about the breach.
            </li>
            <li>
              The OPC has published a reporting form the should be used for
              reporting breaches which can be accessed here:
            </li>

          <br />
          <h5>6.3 Record Keeping</h5>
          <p>
            We must notify affected individuals if it is determined that there
            is a RROSH. How the notification will take place depends on several
            factors such as if contact information of the impacted individuals
            is known, cost, and if the method chosen to deliver such a
            notification will cause further harm. Issuing notification that
            contains:
          </p>
          <ol type="A">
            <li>A description of the circumstances of the breach;</li>
            <li>The day or period during which the breach occurred;</li>
            <li>
              A description of the personal information that was involved in the
              breach;
            </li>
            <li>
              the steps that the organization has taken to reduce the risk of
              harm to the impacted individuals;
            </li>
            <li>
              The steps that the impacted individuals could take to reduce the
              risk of harm resulting from the breach;
            </li>
            <li>
              A toll-free number or email address that the impacted individuals
              can use to obtain further information about the breach; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Information about the organization’s internal complaint process
              and about the individual’s right under PIPEDA and that they can
              make a complaint with the privacy commissioner.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            We must also notify other organizations or government institutions
            if we believe they may be able to reduce the risk of harm to the
            impacted individuals. (i.e. law enforcement agencies). If this is
            the case, consent of individuals is not required for such
            disclosures.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>6.4 Record Keeping</h5>
          <p>
            Organizations are required to keep and maintain records of all
            breaches of security safeguards, including those that do not meet
            the harm threshold for reporting and notification. These records
            must be provided to the privacy commissioner upon request. Records
            must be maintained for 24 months from the day that the organization
            determined that the breach occurred, and that they contain
            sufficient information to enable the privacy commissioner to verify
            compliance with the breach reporting obligations.

            timely. This process is in addition to processes for withdrawing of
            consent. Trackon must respond as quickly as possible within 30 days.

          <h3>9. Law Enforcement Requests</h3>
          <p>
            There may be exceptional times when Trackon is required to disclose
            personal information, without an individual’s consent, in order to
            comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order or other law
            enforcement request. Similarly, Trackon may disclose personal
            information without consent to a government institution or an
            investigative body for a purpose such as national security, national
            defence or the deterrence of terrorism, law enforcement, or in
            relation to a suspected money- laundering offence. <br />
            <br />
            If Trackon receives a request from law enforcement the Privacy
            Officer must be notified immediately. <br />
            <br />
            A request has to be in writing:In order to understand the request,
            the Compliance Officer will request a subpoena, Court Order or other
            evidence, if it has not been provided. This documentation protects
            the company and Compliance Officer in the request for information
            and the release of information under Canadian privacy law. <br />
            <br />
            The person requesting information should be identified and the date
            of the request should be recorded. The request should be analyzed
            and clarification should be sought from the law enforcement officer
            if necessary before any information is disclosed. Exemptions under
            PIPEDA should also be consulted6. <br />
            <br />
            Once the supporting evidence of received and information request is
            understood, Trackon will comply with the information request in a
            format reasonable to the request such as having the individual
            review records in the office or providing paper copies of
            information. Trackon will retain copies of any and all information
            disclosed during this process for a minimum of five years. <br />
            <br />
            It is possible that the individual concerned may request access to
            information related to this disclosure. If this happens, Trackon
            must notify the institution to which the information was disclosed.
            The institution has 30 days to respond. <br />
            <br />
            Trackon may not respond to the individual’s access request before
            either hearing back from the institution or until 30 days has passed
            since Trackon notified it; whichever occurs first. If the
            institution objects to the release of the information to the
            individual based on permissible grounds, Trackon must withhold it.
            Trackon may not reveal that we communicated with the institution, or
            that it objected to the disclosure.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>10. CASL Compliance Program</h3>
          <p>
            CASL is Canada’s anti-spam law that applies to all electronic
            messages (i.e. email, texts) and governs how Trackon communicates
            related to its commercial activity. Trackon is responsible for
            ensuring all commercial electronic messages (CEMs) comply with the
            requirements of CASL. Trackon is required to obtain an individual’s
            express consent before sending messages, manage unsubscribe requests
            and ensure CEMs clearly identify who is sending the message. In
            addition, the CRTC has outlined CASL compliance program requirements
            that Trackon must adhere to.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>10.1 Senior management involvement</h5>
          <p>
            Trackon must identify a point person who is responsible and
            accountable for compliance with the Rules and/or CASL. Trackon has
            chosen Lee Ernest Fox as this person.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>10.2 Risk assessment</h5>
          <p>
            The Privacy Officer is to conduct a risk assessment to determine
            which business activities are at risk for possible violations under
            CASL. Where there is a risk, procedures are put into place to
            mitigate.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>10.3 Requirements for CEM</h5>
          <p>
            In order to ensure any commercial electronic messages, such as
            emails promoting a Trackon’s services that we send, we must comply
            with the following requirements:
          </p>
          <ol type="A">
            <li>A. Obtaining consent;</li>
            <li>B. Including required information; and</li>
            <li>C. Including an appropriate unsubscribe mechanism.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            CEMs can include messages that have another primary purpose (for
            example a Christmas card) but also include messaging promoting a
            product or service.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>10.3.1 Obtaining Consent</h5>
          <p>
            To send a CEM, Trackon needs express consent, either orally or in
            writing. Written consent can be electronic. Consent must be obtained
            prior to sending any communication, excluding ones that are exempt
            under regulations. Express consent cannot be obtained via a CEM,
            unless you already have implied consent. Trackon ensures express
            consent requires a positive or explicit indication of consent. A
            record of what type of information or content a customer has agreed
            to receive (i.e. e-newsletters, sales info, product promotions,
            etc.) must be retained.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>10.3.2 Information to be included in CEMs</h5>
          <p>
            Each CEM must identify the sender of the message and, if applicable,
            the person(s) on whose behalf the message is sent. Trackon must
            ensure that each CEM contains the full mailing address of the person
            sending the message or, if different, the mailing address of the
            person on whose behalf the message is sent. Additionally, a URL,
            email address, or phone number, where the sender can be contacted
            should be included. This information must be valid for at least 60
            days after the message has Confidential 17 been sent. This
            information should also be included in a request for consent. The
            subject line of the CEM must accurately describe the contents of the
            message.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>10.3.3 Unsubscribe mechanism for CEMs</h5>
          <p>
            Each CEM must contain an unsubscribe mechanism. Trackon must ensure
            that each CEM contains an unsubscribe mechanism that is clearly and
            prominently located and easy for the consumer to use. Trackon must
            honor all unsubscribe requests within 10 days following receipt of
            the request.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>
            10.3.4 Requirements Related to Installation of Computer Programs
          </h5>
          <p>
            Trackon is required to obtain consent before the installation of a
            computer program, including installation of digital platforms, that
            will do one or more of the following:
          </p>
          <p>
            A. collect personal information stored on the computer; <br />
            B. interfere with the user’s control of the computer system; and{" "}
            <br />
            C. change or interfere with settings, preferences, or commands
            already installed or stored on the computer system without the
            knowledge of the owner or an authorized user of the computer system.{" "}
            <br />
            <br /> The consent must obtain an acknowledgement from the person
            from whom consent is being sought that he or she understands and
            agrees that the program performs the specified functions. Consent
            may be obtained via an empty toggle box, separate from a license
            agreement and other requests for consent.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>10.3.5 Additional Compliance</h5>
          <p>
            In addition to this Policy Trackon may also implement the following:
          </p>
          <ol type="A">
            <li>Procedures for compliance with CASL;</li>
            <li>CASL Training;</li>
            <li>An auditing and monitoring program;</li>
            <li>
              Procedures for dealing with third to ensure that they comply with
              CASL;
            </li>
            <li>
              Record keeping requirements especially with respect to consent;
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              A means to allow employees to provide feedback to the Privacy
              Officer in relation to CASL.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />

          <h5>10.3.6 Record keeping</h5>
          <p>
            Trackon must ensure records related to obtaining consent and
            managing unsubscribe are kept. Records may be kept in hard copy or
            electronic form and may help in investigating and responding to
            consumer complaints or establish a due diligence defense in the
            event of complaints to the Commission against the business.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>10.3.7 Training program</h5>
          <p>
            Trackon should implement CASL training. Training should contain what
            is required under legislation and the penalties for not meeting
            those requirements. For training to be effective, links should be
            made to TRACKON’s procedures and include examples that staff may
            face in their daily activities. The training should be adapted and
            re-administered when there are changes to the business or changes in
            regulation.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>10.3.8 Auditing and monitoring</h5>
          <p>
            Trackon must have in place auditing and monitoring mechanisms to
            help prevent and detect CASL compliance issues. Trackon must ensure
            that audits are conducted regularly (with or without external help).{" "}
            <br />
            <br />
            The results of all such monitoring activities should be recorded,
            maintained, and communicated to senior management. Any finding or
            recommendations should be addressed in a timely fashion.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>10.3.9 Corrective action</h5>
          <p>
            Trackon takes corrective actions, or provides refresher training, as
            appropriate, to address non-compliance with CASL requirements. A
            record of the contravention and the actions taken should be kept.
          </p>
