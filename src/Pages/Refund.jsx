      <h5>8.1</h5>
      <p>
        We will refund your money within three business days of your request to
        cancel a transfer as long as the funds have not already been picked up
        or deposited into a recipient's account.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5>8.2</h5>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise specifically stated herein, if you wish to exercise
        your right to cancel a Transaction under this clause, you must submit a
        written request to Customer Service, at info@moneyfirst.com.au by email
        or by mail to Add 28 harriet lane , Oxenford QLD 4210, Australia, such
        written request to include: the Customer's full name, address, and phone
        number, the transaction tracking number, Transaction Amount, and the

      <h5>8.3</h5>
      <p>
        If Receiver rejects your funds or you request a refund outside the
        timing or other requirements of Para. 8.1, we may charge you a fee to
        refund the Transaction Amount back to your Payment Account after
        deducting the applicable fee for the Service rendered.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5>8.4</h5>
      <p>
        We will only refund the Transaction Amount if the transaction was not
        already paid to the Receiver (in which case we will also cancel any
        pending Transaction to the same Receiver).
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5>8.5</h5>

        Refunds will be credited to the same Payment Instrument used to pay for
        the Transaction. Refunds are only made in AUD. Refund amounts will not
        be adjusted to account for changes in the value of the AUD or foreign
        currency from the time your Transaction was submitted to the time of
        refund.
